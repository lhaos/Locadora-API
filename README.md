# Locadora-API
This API was very simply created to create users, list movies, and rent / return movies.
It can be improved to do more, as it was created without knowing much about Node.js, it is probable that new more implemented versions will emerge.
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To use this API you only need to have installed Node.js and have a database in Mysql (In this repository there is one available with your ER).
## API Reference
All other information about the use of the API can be seen through this [link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3179178/locadora/77pYLRN).
